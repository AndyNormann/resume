## 04-2018-11-2019  Consultant, Netcompany
General maintenance on the websites for Oslo kommune as well as the redesign of oslo.kommune.no and miljohovedstaden.no. The frontend is done with a mix of pure html/css components and vuejs. I also worked on developing a design system for use in Oslo kommune which we were using ourselves as we were working on the websites, it can be seen here: styleguide.oslo.kommune.no. The design system was managed by myself, one other developer and one1 designer, so I have been a part of the decision making process the whole way.
## 08-2017-04-2018  Consultant, Symfoni Next Generation
Worked on an app for a taxi service, I was responsible for the app that was going to be used by the drivers, as well as the admin page. The app was made using react native and the admin page in react. The project had no designers or managers so I planned, designed, implemented and tested the app/admin page myself. I also did some work on our backend which was written in Go using go-kit. The api was made using graph-ql and I worked on making resolvers. All our environments were run using docker and kubernetes and were deployed to Google Cloud.
